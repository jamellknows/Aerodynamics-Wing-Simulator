# Aerodynamics-Wing-Simulator
Wing Simulator
Overview
Welcome to the Wing Simulator, a tool designed for simulating the aerodynamics of individual NACA airfoils and 3D airfoils based on new equations derived from the Navier-Stokes problem. This simulator consists of two main components: wind_sim for individual NACA airfoils and wing_sim for 3D airfoils. The wing_sim utilizes the wind_sim module to simulate the aerodynamic behavior of the entire wing.

Prerequisites
Before using the Wing Simulator, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Python 3.x
Dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file
You can install the required dependencies by running:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
1. Running wind_sim for Individual NACA Airfoils
Navigate to the directory containing the wind_sim.py file and run the following command:


python wind_sim.py
This will execute the simulation for individual NACA airfoils based on the new equations derived from the Navier-Stokes problem.

2. Running wing_sim for 3D Airfoils
Navigate to the directory containing the wing_sim.py file and run the following command:

python wing_sim.py
The wing_sim script internally calls wind_sim to simulate the aerodynamics of individual NACA airfoils and combines the results to provide a comprehensive analysis of 3D airfoils.

Equations and Research
The simulator is based on equations derived from the Navier-Stokes problem, as presented in the research paper titled "THE NAVIER-STOKES EQUATION: A FIRST LOOK." You can find the paper at the following link:

The Navier-Stokes Equation: A First Look

For a detailed understanding of the underlying equations and methodology, refer to the provided research paper.
